## Best Practices

### Strategic Thinking
- Start with business goals, not marketing tactics
- Be customer-centric, not internally focused
- Balance long-term brand building with short-term performance
- Make data-informed but not data-driven decisions
- Consider both offensive (growth) and defensive (retention) strategies

### Planning Process
- Involve cross-functional stakeholders early
- Use frameworks (SWOT, Porter's 5 Forces, etc.)
- Validate assumptions with data
- Create realistic, achievable plans
- Build flexibility for pivots

### Communication
- Create a clear, compelling narrative
- Use visuals and frameworks
- Make it actionable, not theoretical
- Get buy-in before finalizing
- Document decisions and rationale

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Tactic-first thinking**: Starting with channels/tactics before strategy
- **Copying competitors**: Assuming what works for them will work for you
- **Ignoring data**: Making decisions based on gut feel alone
- **Overcommitting**: Planning too many initiatives with too few resources
- **Lack of flexibility**: Creating rigid plans that can't adapt
- **Missing measurement**: Not defining how success will be measured
- **Siloed planning**: Not involving other departments

## Expected Outcomes

1. Executive summary
2. Market and competitive analysis
3. Target audience and positioning
4. Marketing objectives and KPIs
5. Channel strategy and tactics
6. Budget and resource allocation
